Pitfalls of 'populations'
=========================

.. note::

	This page is still in progress.

There are limitations to population-based notions of ancestry:

* Populations are often labels chosen by the researcher to make models more interpretable.
* There is always variation within populations.
* Different populations may be relevant in different epochs.
* Gene flow is often gradual and spatial in nature.
* (Consider the history of population genetics in humans:) eugenics happened.

An alternative is to think about ancestry on the level of individuals.
